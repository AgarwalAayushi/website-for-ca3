<p class="p1">Welcome to Alumni Management System</p>
<p class="p2">Let's keep in touch.. <br><br> </p>
<p class="p3">Are you missing them? Your coursemates, your squad, your friends who were up all night with you for assignments, gathering, events and so on.
Come and let's get in touch with your friends that you miss!<br><br> 
Welcome back dearest alumni. Genuinely, one of our greatest assets is our global network of alumni. This page is to celebrate your achievements and provides you an access to our alumni community.
A beginning was made to connect all the ex-students and bring them under one roof. We went through its ups and downs, but the spark that was ignited and kept burning. We are now being revived with renewed zest and vigor and the website is the first initiative to create a 24/7 interface for our brethren spread across the globe to interact and come together and make this a truly representative Association.</p>
